## Meeting Notes

- Alpine Linux intro [slides](https://dev.alpinelinux.org/~ncopa/presentations/alpine-security-mission.html)
  - Question: what's the strategy for getting rid of SUID? File capabilities?
    - Answer: no real plan
  - Question: what's the strategy in the face of no more public GRSecurity
    patches?
    - Answer: Currently forward porting last test patch, slightly risky, not a
      good solution. May discontinue use at some point.
  - Question: Thoughts on capabilities?
    - Answer: fs-caps sound like a nice way to get rid of SUID bits, since
      they're uid-independent.
  - Question: Thoughts on LSMs?
    - Answer: SELinux is complicated, AppArmor is simpler and perhaps better in
      that sense, not on the roadmap currently for Alpine to implement default
      profiles (but may be in the future)
  - Question: What exactly is the deal with TLS?
    - glibc does *lazy* allocation, so after pthread_create(), at some later
      point, the actual allocation for TLS may fail, and glibc simply aborts().
      This is one reason dlopen is a noop, but not the only reason.
