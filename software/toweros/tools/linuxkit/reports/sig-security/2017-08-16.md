## Meeting Notes

- okernel intro by HPE [slides](https://files.tycho.ws/linux-okernel.pdf)
  - Question: is it possible to do KVM and okernel stuff on the same machine
    given that they both use EPT? Answer: theoretically yes, but untested.
  - Question: what's the goal of this work? Answer: definitely upstreaming it
    at some point, although some cleanup and such needs to happen.
  - Question: what's the interest in XPFO? Answer: want to track when +x pages
    come back from userspace, so that we can set them -x.
