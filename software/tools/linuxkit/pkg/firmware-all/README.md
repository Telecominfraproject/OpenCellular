The `firmware-all` package contains all firmware binaries from the
[Linux firmware
repository](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git/). It
is quite large.

For use with the LinuxKit kernel we recommend using the
[`firmware`](../firmware/) package, which only contains the firmware
binaries for which drivers are enabled.
