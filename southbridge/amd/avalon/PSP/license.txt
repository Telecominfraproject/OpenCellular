THE STABILITY OF YOUR COMPUTING SYSTEM; AND (C) OTHER EXPERIENCES

DIRECT, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES INCLUDING

8.  CONFIDENTIALITY. You shall protect the Licensed Software and any

information of a like nature.   You shall not disclose any Confidential
Information disclosed hereunder to any third party and shall limit
disclosure of Confidential Information to only those of its employees
and contractors with a need to know and who are bound by confidentiality
obligations with You at least as restrictive as those contained in this

adherence to the terms of this Agreement.  You may disclose Confidential
Information in accordance with a judicial or other governmental order,
provided that You either (a) give AMD reasonable notice prior to such
disclosure to allow AMD a reasonable opportunity to seek a protective
order or equivalent or (b) obtain written assurance from the applicable
judicial or governmental entity that it will afford the Confidential
Information the highest level of protection afforded under applicable
law or regulation.

the Agreement upon thirty (30) days written notice to AMD.  The
termination of this Agreement shall:

        provisions survive except for Section 2. Upon termination
