/**
 * This module allows us to expose a virtual UART port to allow us to forward
 * UART traffic to another UART for traffic monitoring and debugging
 *
 * It is currently very basic - it assumes debug UART & watched UART support
 * the exact same settings. Additionally, it only supports blocking read/write
 * and will only show incoming data that has been read by the subscriber (i.e.
 * unless the task has called UART_read, no data is pushed to the debug port)
 *
 * To use this driver, simply add a new entry to the UART_Config array:
 *
 * 1. Add a new entry to the UARTName enum
 *
 * 2. Create a new cfg/object instance & provide it the port # of the UART to
 *    monitor and the UART to forward to:
 *      UartMon_Object uart_mon_obj;
 *      const UartMon_Cfg uart_mon_cfg = {
 *          .uart_in_idx = OC_CONNECT1_UARTXR0,
 *          .uart_debug_idx = OC_CONNECT1_UART0,
 *      };
 *
 * 3. Add new entry to UART_Config array:
 *      [OC_CONNECT1_UARTMON] = {
 *          .fxnTablePtr = &UartMon_fxnTable,
 *          .object = &uart_mon_obj,
 *          .hwAttrs = &uart_mon_cfg,
 *      },
 *
 * 4. Open this new UART port and use it as usual (note: you can switch back to
 *    the regular UART at any time - this driver will only have an effect once
 *    it is open):
 *      UART_open(OC_CONNECT1_UARTMON, &uartParams);
 *
