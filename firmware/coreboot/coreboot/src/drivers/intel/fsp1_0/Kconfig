config HAVE_FSP_BIN
	bool "Use Intel Firmware Support Package"
	help
	  Select this option to add an Intel FSP binary to
	  the resulting coreboot image.

	  Note: Without this binary, coreboot builds relying on the FSP
	  will not boot

config DCACHE_RAM_BASE
	hex
	default 0xfef00000

config DCACHE_RAM_SIZE
	hex
	default 0x4000

if HAVE_FSP_BIN

config FSP_FILE
	string "Intel FSP binary path and filename"
	help
	  The path and filename of the Intel FSP binary for this platform.

endif #HAVE_FSP_BIN

config FSP_LOC
	hex "Intel FSP Binary location in CBFS"
	help
	  The location in CBFS that the FSP is located. This must match the
	  value that is set in the FSP binary.  If the FSP needs to be moved,
	  rebase the FSP with Intel's BCT (tool).

config ENABLE_FSP_FAST_BOOT
	bool "Enable Fast Boot"
	select ENABLE_MRC_CACHE
	default n
	help
	  Enabling this feature will force the MRC data to be cached in NV
	  storage to be used for speeding up boot time on future reboots
	  and/or power cycles.

config ENABLE_MRC_CACHE
	bool
	default y if HAVE_ACPI_RESUME
	default n
	help
	  Enabling this feature will cause MRC data to be cached in NV storage.
	  This can either be used for fast boot, or just because the FSP wants
	  it to be saved.

config MRC_CACHE_FMAP
	bool "Use MRC Cache in FMAP"
	depends on ENABLE_MRC_CACHE
	default n
	help
	  Use the region "RW_MRC_CACHE" in FMAP instead of "mrc.cache" in CBFS.
	  You must define a region in your FMAP named "RW_MRC_CACHE".

config MRC_CACHE_SIZE
	hex "Fast Boot Data Cache Size"
	default 0x10000
	depends on ENABLE_MRC_CACHE
	depends on !MRC_CACHE_FMAP
	help
	  This is the amount of space in NV storage that is reserved for the
	  fast boot data cache storage.

	  WARNING: Because this area will be erased and re-written, the size
	  should be a full sector of the flash ROM chip and nothing else should
	  be included in CBFS in any sector that the fast boot cache data is in.

config VIRTUAL_ROM_SIZE
	hex "Virtual ROM Size"
	default ROM_SIZE
	depends on ENABLE_MRC_CACHE
	help
	  This is used to calculate the offset of the MRC data cache in NV
	  Storage for fast boot.  If in doubt, leave this set to the default
	  which sets the virtual size equal to the ROM size.

	  Example: Cougar Canyon 2 has two 8 MB SPI ROMs.  When the SPI ROMs are
	  loaded with a 4 MB coreboot image, the virtual ROM size is 8 MB.  When
	  the SPI ROMs are loaded with an 8 MB coreboot image, the virtual ROM
	  size is 16 MB.

config USE_GENERIC_FSP_CAR_INC
	bool
	default n
	help
	  The chipset can select this to use a generic cache_as_ram.inc file
	  that should be good for all FSP based platforms.

config FSP_USES_UPD
	bool
	default n
	help
	  If this FSP uses UPD/VPD data regions, select this in the chipset Kconfig.
