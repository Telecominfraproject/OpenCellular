	  Although the Intel manual says you must set the lock bit in addition
	  to the VMX bit in order for VMX to work, this isn't strictly true, so
	  we have the option to leave it unlocked and allow the OS (e.g. Linux)
	  to manage things itself. This is beneficial for testing purposes as
	  there is no need to reflash the firmware just to toggle the lock bit.
	  However, leaving the lock bit unset will break Windows' detection of
	  VMX support and built-in virtualization features like Hyper-V.
