/* Calculate clock fractional divider value from ref and target frequencies.
 * This is for a U7.1 format. This is not well written up in the book and
 * there have been some questions about this macro, so here we go.
 * U7.1 format is defined as (ddddddd+1) + (h*.5)
 * The lowest order bit is actually a fractional bit.
 * Hence, the divider can be thought of as 9 bits.
 * So:
 * divider = ((ref/freq) << 1 - 1) (upper 7 bits) |
 *	(ref/freq & 1) (low order half-bit)
 * however we can't do fractional arithmetic ... these are integers!
 * So we normalize by shifting the result left 1 bit, and extracting
 * ddddddd and h directly to the returned u8.
 * divider = 2*(ref/freq);
 * We want to
 * preserve 7 bits of divisor and one bit of fraction, in 8 bits, as well as
 * subtract one from ddddddd. Since we computed ref*2, the dddddd is now nicely
 * situated in the upper 7 bits, and the h is sitting there in the low order
 * bit. To subtract 1 from ddddddd, just subtract 2 from the 8-bit number
 * and voila, upper 7 bits are (ref/freq-1), and lowest bit is h. Since you
 * will assign this to a u8, it gets nicely truncated for you.

/* Calculate clock frequency value from reference and clock divider value
 * The discussion in the book is pretty lacking.
 * The idea is that we need to divide a ref clock by a divisor
 * in U7.1 format, where 7 upper bits are the integer
 * and lowest order bit is a fraction.
 * from the book, U7.1 is (ddddddd+1) + (h*.5)
 * To normalize to an actual number, we might do this:
 * ((d>>7+1)&0x7f) + (d&1 >> 1)
 * but as you might guess, the low order bit would be lost.
 * Since we can't express the fractional bit, we need to multiply it all by 2.
 * ((d + 2)&0xfe) + (d & 1)
 * Since we're just adding +2, the lowest order bit is preserved. Hence
 * (d+2) is the same as ((d + 2)&0xfe) + (d & 1)
 *
 * Since you multiply denominator * 2 (by NOT shifting it),
 * you multiply numerator * 2 to cancel it out.
