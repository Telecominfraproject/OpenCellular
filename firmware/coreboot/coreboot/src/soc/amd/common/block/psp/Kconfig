	  Some PSP implementations allow storing SMU firmware into cbfs and
	  calling the PSP to load the blobs at the proper time.

	  The soc/<codename> should select this if its PSP supports the feature
	  and each mainboard can choose to select an appropriate fanless or
	  fanned set of blobs.  Ask your AMD representative whether your APU
	  is considered fanless.
