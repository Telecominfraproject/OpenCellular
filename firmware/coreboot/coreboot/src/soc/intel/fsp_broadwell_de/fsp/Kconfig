config FSP_FILE
	string
	default "../intel/fsp/broadwell_de/BROADWELLDE_FSP.bin"
	help
	  The path and filename of the Intel FSP binary for this platform.

config FSP_LOC
	hex
	default 0xffeb0000
	help
	  The location in CBFS that the FSP is located. This must match the
	  value that is set in the FSP binary.  If the FSP needs to be moved,
	  rebase the FSP with Intel's BCT (tool).

	  The Broadwell-DE FSP is built with a preferred base address of
	  0xffeb0000.

config DCACHE_RAM_BASE
	hex
	default 0xfe100000
	help
	  This address needs to match the setup performed inside FSP.
	  On Broadwell-DE the FSP allocates temporary RAM starting at 0xfe100000.

config DCACHE_RAM_SIZE
	hex
	default 0x8000
	help
	  The DCACHE is shared between FSP itself and the rest of the coreboot
	  stages. A size of 0x8000 works fine while providing enough space for
	  features like VBOOT in verstage. Further increase to a power of two
	  aligned value leads to errors in FSP.
