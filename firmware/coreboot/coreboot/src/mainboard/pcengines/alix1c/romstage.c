	 * care about what is in the stack.  If we are smart we set
	 * the CAR stack to the same location as the rest of
	 * coreboot. If that is the case we can just do a wbinvd.
	 * The stack will be written into real RAM that is now setup
	 * and we continue like nothing happened.  If the stack is
	 * located somewhere other than where LB would like it, you
	 * need to write some code to do a copy from cache to RAM
