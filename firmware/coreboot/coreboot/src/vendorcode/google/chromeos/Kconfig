	  Disable the platform heirarchy on resume path if the firmware
	  is involved in resume. The hierarchy is disabled prior to jumping
	  to the OS.  Note that this option is sepcific to TPM2 boards.
	  This option is auto selected if CHROMEOS because it matches with
	  vboot_reference model which disables the platform hierarchy in
	  the boot loader. However, those operations need to be symmetric
	  on normal boot as well as resume and coreboot is only involved
	  in the resume piece w.r.t. the platform hierarchy.
