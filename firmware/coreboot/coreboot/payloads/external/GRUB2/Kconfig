	help
	  The GRUB2 payload reads its runtime configuration file from etc/grub.cfg
	  stored in the CBFS on the flash ROM chip. Without that, itâ€™ll just drop
	  into a rescue shell.

	  This configuration may need to be coreboot specific.

	  Select this option, if you want to include the GRUB2 runtime
	  configuration file into CBFS as `etc/grub.cfg` automatically.

	  You will be able to specify the path of the configuration file later.

	  Without this option you would need to add this file manually with
	  build/cbfstool build/coreboot.rom add -f grub.cfg -n etc/grub.cfg -t raw

config GRUB2_RUNTIME_CONFIG_FILE
	string "Path of grub.cfg"
	depends on GRUB2_INCLUDE_RUNTIME_CONFIG_FILE

	  The path of the GRUB2 runtime configuration file to be added to CBFS.
