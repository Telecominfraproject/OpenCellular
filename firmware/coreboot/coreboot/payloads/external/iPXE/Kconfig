	  The comma-separated PCI vendor and device ID that would associate
	  your PXE ROM to your network card.

	  Example: 10ec,8168

	  In the above example 10ec is the PCI vendor ID (in hex, but without
	  the "0x" prefix) and 8168 specifies the PCI device ID of the
	  network card (also in hex, without "0x" prefix).

	  Under GNU/Linux you can run `lspci -nn` to list the IDs of your PCI devices.
